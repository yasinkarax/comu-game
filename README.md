# My First Scratch Game

Hi! This project is a basic scratch game I developed for my school project at Ã‡anakkale 18 Mart University.

There are 3 different stages in the game. There is a bug in the bottom left game, so you cannot play it for fun.

I used photoshop for the first time while working on this game. I extracted the door, earth, stars, meteor, home, maze, and road from images. I was very inexperienced and couldn't get smooth edges :) I erased some parts of the maze to make it more challenging. I created the rotating yellow obstacle myself.

Enjoy!
